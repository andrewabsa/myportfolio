    <h1>My Current Projects</h1>
    <p>These are the current projects that I have been working on</p>
    <h2>Project #1:Rock Paper Scissors With Python:</h2>
    <article>This project is one of my more fun ad intuitive projects.<br>
    I am currently experimenting using python to create a program
    <br>where you can basically play rock paper scissors by yourself.<br>
    This works by putting user input into python and getting an<br>automated
    response each time in relation to the game.<br>This is possible 
    using recurring loops such as "while" loops.

    <h2>Project #2:Antivirus Project:</h2>
    <article>
    Creating an easy and exploiting tool which compiles a<br>malaware
    with popular payload and then the compiled malware<br>can be executed
    on most operating systems including windows,<br>android and mac. This malware
    also has the ability to bypass<br>antivirus software protection.

    <h2>Project #3:Encryption software:</h2>
    <article>Again with this project I am using Python to create
        an encryption<br>software which will focus on symmetric-key encryption.
        That being<br>said, the same key will be used to encrypt and decrypt
        the message.<br>The key that i will be using is a lighter form of
        of a UTF-8 character<br>encoding. The entire encryption software will 
        include nearly 1000<br>characters including both upper and lower case.
