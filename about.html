    <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
<article>
    I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. Spent all
    my life here except for the occassional holiday. Have always
    had a keen interest in computers and really anything
    related to technology.<br><br> In my free time I really enjoy
    an active lifestyle, including going to the gym and participating
    in sports such as Swimming, Basketball and Soccer. Apart from 
    playing sports I also love watching certain sports especially
    Basketball.<br><br>When I have time I like to watch a live, local game
    in person, one of my lifelong goals is to watch the NBA in person
    in the United States.
