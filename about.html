            <!--Main Article-->
            <article> I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. Spent all
                my life here except for the occassional holiday. Have always
                had a keen interest in computers and really anything
                related to technology.<br><br> In my free time I really enjoy
                an active lifestyle, including going to the gym and participating
                in sports such as Swimming, Basketball and Soccer. Apart from 
                playing sports I also love watching certain sports especially
                Basketball.<br><br>Currently studying an intensive course CoderAcademy,
                 and am looking to develop my skill-set and work really hard to achieve
                my goals.</article>
