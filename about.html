            <h1>A little about me...</h1>
            <article> I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. Spent all
                my life here except for the occassional holiday. Have always
                had a keen interest in computers and really anything
                related to technology.<br><br> In my free time I really enjoy
                an active lifestyle, including going to the gym and participating
                in sports such as Swimming, Basketball and Soccer. Apart from 
                playing sports I also love watching certain sports especially
                Basketball.<br><br>When I have time I like to watch a live, local game
                in person, one of my lifelong goals is to watch the NBA in person
                in the United States. </article>

                        lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times<br>
                        the price of an average software writer.”
